# materialctrl
## A sample Material Control app to serve as one of my portfolio items.

This project demonstrate the use of the following frameworks and/or technologies:
1. ASP.NET Core Web Application - Web API, Razor views used in the layout, ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication
2. JSON Web Token to secure the Web API access
3. Angular - Main UI framework. The project uses modular structure for each features.
4. Angular Material - Layout and theming
5. ag-Grid - Data grid

Currently, all files are contained in a single .csproj. Will break this down into multiple VS projects soon.
